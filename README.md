# Bolt Dash (C++)

A dashboard for an electric superbike, written in C++, Qt6, and QML

## Description

This project is build specifically for BOLT VS at Virginia Tech, and is
designed to use all of our specific parameters. This program is intended to be run on a Raspberry Pi with CAN and Qt6 already installed and set up. The dashboard will read from a CAN bus to see a multitude of information about the bike, and display most of it on a GUI for a rider to easily see what is happening.

## Visuals

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation

To install CAN on a Rasbperry Pi, we use an off the shelf CAN HAT for Raspberry Pi's. Then, we followed the manufacturers instructions for getting it set up in Linux.

Then, we install Qt by running `sudo apt install qt6-base-dev`

## Usage

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Roadmap

If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.
